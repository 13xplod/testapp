# TESTAPP

This is a **simple test app** I created to learn Java and Android development.

---

## What does this app do?

- Displays a list of cities in Serbia using **RecyclerView**.
- Shows **Belgrade** as the capital city with a **star icon**.
- Other cities have a different city icon.
- Uses string arrays and images as resources.

---

## What did I learn?

- How to use RecyclerView with custom adapters.
- How to work with resources (`strings.xml`, images).
- Basic Android Studio project setup and GitHub integration.

Feel free to explore the code and learn along!
